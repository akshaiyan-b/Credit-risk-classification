## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-risk-classification.git
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   - Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Run the Flask application:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

3. Access the frontend:
   - Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to input user data.
   - Submit the form to get the risk prediction.
   - View the result on the `result.html` page.

## Usage

In this Machine Learning model you can easily download which ever model you want. I have made and runned this dataset with many different type of machine learning model, you can download model has the highest accuracy. I have also nat used all the machine learning model that are present there, if you are not satisfied with the model, you can again import your own model for getting the best accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- Machine Learning: Decision Tree, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Neural Network
- Frontend: HTML, CSS
- Backend: Flask
- Data Serialization: Pickle
